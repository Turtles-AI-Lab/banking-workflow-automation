```

## 🎮 Usage

### For Implementation Teams:
1. Configure workflow steps in the visual builder
2. Set business rules and validation criteria
3. Map integration endpoints
4. Test end-to-end process flow
5. Generate documentation for stakeholders

### For End Users (Demo):
1. Fill out account opening application
2. Upload required documents
3. Track application status in real-time
4. Receive automated notifications

## 🔑 Key Capabilities Demonstrated
