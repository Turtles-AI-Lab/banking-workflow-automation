## Security Features

This banking workflow automation platform implements:

- ✅ **XSS Protection**: HTML escaping for all user-controlled data
- ✅ **API Authentication**: X-API-Key required for all endpoints
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate all inputs
- ✅ **PII Redaction**: Sensitive data redacted in logs
- ✅ **Fraud Detection**: AI-powered fraud scoring
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: Strict-Transport-Security headers

## Compliance Considerations

**This is a demonstration platform. For production use, ensure:**
- GLBA compliance (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)
- PCI-DSS compliance for payment data
- KYC/AML compliance for identity verification
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Known Limitations

**Demonstration Platform Notice:**
- Uses in-memory storage (not persistent)
- Mock integrations for KYC/AML/fraud checks
- Simplified business rules
- No database encryption (in-memory only)

**For Production Deployment:**
- Implement PostgreSQL with encryption
- Use real KYC/AML providers
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
